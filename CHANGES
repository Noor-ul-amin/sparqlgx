                ===============================

This file lists the various versions of SPARQLGX with their dates,
their commit hashes and their main new features from the previous
official version.

A list of versions is available with: ``git tag -l -n1``.


v1.1
Wed Apr 26 14:14:49 2017 +0200
commit hash 25a317598e8bb5124e794454b624cf035fabe3a2
   - Faster load routine which widely improves this phase perfomances
     by reading once the initial triple file and by partitioning data
     in the same time into the correct predicate files.
   - Improving the generated Scala-code of the translation process
     with mapValues. This technic allows not to break the partitioning
     of KeyValueRDD while applying transformations to the values
     instead of the traditional map that was done prior.
   - Merging and cleaning several scripts in bin/ such as for example
     sgx-eval.sh and sde-eval.sh
   - Improving the compilation process of compile.sh
   - Cleaner test scripts in tests/
   - Offering the possibility of an easier deployment using Docker.

v1.0
Mon Oct 10 09:34:30 2016 +0200
commit hash 1a3497958e0b6729255622f0e3d0969e1252f69d
   - First Version of SPARQLGX which corresponds to the work presented
     at ISWC2016 (Kobe, Japan) and BDA2016 (Poitiers, France). For
     more information, see the related publications. In a nutshell,
     SPARQLGX allows to load RDF dataset and evaluate SPARQL queries
     using Apache Spark. Basically, it uses the vertical partitioning
     approach to store the data and translates the queries into
     Spark-compliant Scala-code.
